config/thresholds.json # Wait, config SHOULD be committed? Yes, it's project config. 
# But 'reports' folder was created by check-mutants.js (check-mutants.cjs now) probably.
# Let's ensure 'reports' is ignored. It is. 
# Also .jscpd.json is now in config, so we can remove it from root ignore if it was there? No, it wasn't.
# Wait, let's keep it simple. Just ensure high level junk is ignored.
